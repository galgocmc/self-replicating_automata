# Evoloops
Evoloops is an extension of SDSR Loops capable of evolution. Although the system dynamics are rather complex, at its simplest, smaller loops are favoured by 'natural selection', and thus over time, loops will tend to replicate into smaller loops. Evoloops is arguably the most well know extension of Langton's Loops, despite it being proposed 15 years after Langton's original proposition.

## Initial State

Evoloops begins in a similar initial state to Langton's Loops, but with a larger loop and no extension arm.
Due to its larger size, Evoloops requires much more space to move than Langton's Loops. However, adding extra space really slows down computations and makes the loops harder to see. Currently, this does not run very well on my computer.
